Breakout 
========
A breakout clone that I made in order to teach
myself about python, pygame, and game development.

Controls: 
- Use mouse to click on menu buttons
- left arrow: moves paddle left
- right arrow: moves paddle right
- P: pauses the game
- ESC: quits to main menu

Installation
------------
Download the zip file and extract the contents. From the game
directory, execute breakout.py on the command line to run the
game. Note that this game requires python 3 and pygame to be 
installed

Level Editor
------------
Game levels can be edited and new levels can be added using the built-in
level editor. Levels must be saved to 'breakout/resources/levels/' directory
in order to be recognized by the game. The level progession is determined
by the giving the name of the next level file in the 'next' entry box 
inside the editor.
